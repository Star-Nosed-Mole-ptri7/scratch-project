/**
 *  useReducer
 *    - When you have 2 dependant states, in the this case the input validity depends on the input value, we can use useReducer
 * 
 *  - iseREducer allows you to manage state in a component and it gives you a func which updates the state and re-renders the component
 *    - the difference between useReducer and useState is that with useReducer, you can manage complex state easier.
 *    - you can write logic that runs whenever you want to change the state to do more complex updates than just setting a new value
 *    - useReducer is great for when you have more complex state or dependency between 2 different states
